## Weather Forecast back-end

This is back-end part of my trial internship project: Weather Forecast web app.

It is implemented on Java using Spring Boot framework.

All Weather data is collected from this XML weather API: 
http://www.ilmateenistus.ee/ilma_andmed/xml/forecast.php?lang=eng 

Swagger was added to this project for quick controller test. 
It can be accessed from this url after running application from WeatherApplication.java:
http://localhost:8080/api/swagger-ui/#/
